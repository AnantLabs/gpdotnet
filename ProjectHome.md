This project is Linux version of http://gpdotnet.codeplex.com open source project developed on Windows platform.

GPdotNET is artificial intelligence tool for applying Genetic Programming and Genetic Algorithm in modeling and optimization of various engineering problems. It is .NET (Mono) application written in C# programming language which can run on both Windows and Linux based OS. Project started in 2006 within postgraduate project for modeling and optimization with evolutionary algorithms. As open source project, GPdotNET is first published on November 5 2009 on codeplex.com. GPdotNET is very easy to use. Even if you have no deep knowledge of GP and GA, you can apply those methods in finding solution. The project can be used in modeling any kind of engineering process, which can be described with discrete data, as well as in education during teaching students about evolutionary methods, mainly GP and GA.

GPdotNET v2.0 supports the following types of modeling and optimizations:

1. Model for Discrete Data â€“ modeling with/or without prediction of discrete data by using Symbolic Regression modeling with GP

2. Model&Opt. for Discrete Data - modeling with/or without prediction of discrete data by using Symbolic Regression with GP and Optimizing calculated GPdotNET model by using GA

3. Model for Time Series - Time Series modeling and prediction data by using Symbolic Regression with GP

4. Optimization of Analytic Function - optimization of analytic defined function by using GA
